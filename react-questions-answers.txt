Unveiling the Battle of Sharing in React: Context API vs. Prop Drilling ⚔️
Prop Drilling:
🔍 Navigate the never-ending staircase of passing props down, down, down...
🏗️ Code bloat & maintenance headaches, the relentless foes of developers.
Context API:
🌐 Globally share data with elegance & simplicity
✨ Components access values effortlessly, entering the realm of clean code bliss.

What is prop drilling in React?
🔹 It refers to the process of passing data down the component tree through multiple layers of nested components. - d
🔹 It occurs when a piece of data needs to be passed from a higher-level parent component to a lower-level child component that is not directly connected by parent-child relationships. - d
🔹 It is also called "lifting state up" or "threading props" - d
🔹 But, while doing so, other components have access to the data or props as we are passing it down the chain. - d 
🔹 This would result in unnecessary exchange of data to the component which don't really need it. - d 
🔹 To avoid this we can use possible solutions like React context API, Redux etc. - d

What is a react router used for in a react application?
Answer: Managing client-side routing
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
Interviewer: What's the useId hook in Reactjs. How is it different from key ?
My answer would be...
Ø useId() is one of the latest hooks added to React 18. 
Ø The useId() hook provides a way to generate unique IDs that persist between re-renders. 
Ø It ensures that generated IDs i.e, returns a string are unique across the entire React app, and until the component that uses the ID is removed from the DOM. Once the component is re-insterted, the generated ID will be different.
Ø The main purpose of the useId() hook is to generate unique IDs for HTML form elements. It simplifies the process of generating unique IDs when creating form inputs and labels in React.
Ø The useId() hook doesn’t take any parameters.
Ø Don’t use useId hook to generate keys. It’s main purpose is to generate unique ids for Form element’s id attribute.
If you find my explanation effective, give it a like, and share any observations or suggestions in the comments.
